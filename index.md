### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    This lab is one of my favorites because it introduces Linux, Bash shell, and GitHub and 
    focuses on configuring Git, creating personal access tokens in GitHub, and working with 
    repositories. It helped me through cloning repositories, editing, and compiling C++ code 
    which emphasized the importance of committing and pushing code changes to GitHub.

* Lab 5
  
    This lab is one of my favorites because we learned about modular programming and learned
    the different elements of our programs that are defined in different files. We also learned
    about header files and unit tests for our functions and how the MAKE command works

* Lab 10 part 1
  
    This lab is one of my favorites because we started to use prime numbers. We also learned how 
    to read and write from files. When doing prime numbers we learned how to find out if a number
    is prime or not.
